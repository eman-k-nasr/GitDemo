this file is added while working on branch 1
suddenly something interrupt u and for example you want to move to another branch 
but you don't want to loase your data 
and on the same time you don't want to commit your work now 

the best solution in this case is use "stash" command

git stash --include-untracked

if you want to return changes from stash you can do this 
git stash apply 

here you're again with changes you left before
